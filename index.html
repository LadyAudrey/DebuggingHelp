Each question is designed to help you think through the problem methodically and with self-kindness.<br><br>After a lot of questions, if you haven't found the bug, I'll encourage you to take a break and come back to it soon. If you do find the bug, hit the button that says 'I found it!' and we'll celebrate your success."</h2>
